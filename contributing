# CONTRIBUTING

The SockJS protocol has stablized somewhat, but this project isn't my only
work, and I'd really appreciate any and all contributions. If you're looking
for places to get started, check out the Issues list. Heck: additions to Issues
are a good place to get started.

Along those lines: please feel free to file an Issue before starting work on a
fork - we're all busy, and I'd hate for you to waste your time on something
that won't get merged.

# GIT RELATED

Fork, hack, pull-request. Nothing fancy. If contribution explodes I may
reconsider this policy.

I personally prefer merge over rebase, but I'm not going to reject your
beautiful lie of a local revision history, if that's what you want to do.

# TESTING

Please do add tests for your changes. I will almost certainly reject PRs
without decent testing.

# ARCHITECTURE

Because of the nature of the project, it's very easy for the code to get
spaghettified. Sessions (and a couple of the protocol handlers) are built on an
State Machine pattern, and code that doesn't align with that will not get
merged. Basically, if you're tempted to use a conditional based on the state of
a connection, *don't.*

# BOUNDARIES

Do not:

* edit the gemspec or the version.rb
